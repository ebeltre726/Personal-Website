Second attempt at Personal Professional Website, aimed at ease of code editing, neatness and following best practice.

GOAL: Create a mobile-first professional portfolio website with minimal functionality that I can showcase to future 
employers, and with time, I can add more functionality or design changes to better express both my technical and 
professional background as well as my artistic and personal background.

PROGRESS: Website is created and public, although future changes aim to improve CSS responsiveness, and add
a "PROJECTS" section that adds projects created on YouTube or GitHub for employers to get a better view of my
skills and capabilities.
